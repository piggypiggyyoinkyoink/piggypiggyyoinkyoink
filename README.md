^ probably me rn

### Aspiring programmer/software developer
 🐷 Familiar with Python, HTML and CSS, JavaScript, Node.js and Django.  
 🐷 Just because I am familar with them doesn't mean my code is any good  
 🐷 If it works, don't touch it (even if it's O(n²!)) - who needs efficiency anyway?  
 🐷 Reach me on [Discord](https://discord.com/users/690959747871932477): @piggyoinkoink

 🐷Fun fact - unlike most software developers I like touching grass and exploring the world around me
